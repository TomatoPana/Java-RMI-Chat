# Java RMI Chat Application

This project is a chat application developed using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to communicate with each other in real-time through a chat interface. The application utilizes the client-server architecture, where multiple clients can connect to a central server and exchange messages.
